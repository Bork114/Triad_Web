The Dawnstars are entrusted with safeguarding the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Relics/Infinite Hourglass.md]] and maintaining the continuity of [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Sphere Building/Cyclical Time.md]]. Should any attempt be made to tamper with it, the Sisterhood will oversee the punishment. Furthermore, in collaboration with the [[../Guild of Gloaming/Sages of The Garden House.md]], the Sisterhood tends to the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Garden House.md]].

# Responsibilities 

The Dawnstars oversee the continuity of [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Sphere Building/Cyclical Time.md]]. Their duties revolve around the care of the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Relics/Infinite Hourglass.md]], located in the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Buildings/Temple of Time.md]] and the management of the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Garden House.md]] located within the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Chrona Spire.md]]. Within the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Buildings/Temple of Time.md]], they monitor the progression of time in other planes of existence and work diligently to minimize the intertwining of various temporal states.
# Worship

Said to be one of the first Keepers created by [[../../../Titan Lore/Titan of Time.md|Time]] itself, [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Eon.md]] founded the Sisterhood of the Crescent-Moon as a founding stone of the [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Aevi Sphere.md]]. However, following the establishment of the Sisterhood, Eon vanished from [[../../../Aevi Sphere/Places/Aevi Sphere.md|Aevi]] and it's influences. With no certainty of [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Eon.md]]'s whereabouts and no leader, the Sisterhood elected a new leader and revered [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Eon.md]] as their source of guidance. Some speculate that Eon perished, while others cling to the hope of their eventual return.
