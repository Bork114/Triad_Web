# Responsibilities 

The Dawnstars oversee the continuity of [[../../../Lore Buikding/Cyclical Time]]. Their duties revolve around the care of the [[../../../_Places/Relics/Infinite Hourglass]], located in the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Buildings/Temple of Time]] and the management of the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Garden House]] located within the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Chrona Spire]]. Within the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Buildings/Temple of Time]], they monitor the progression of time in other planes of existence and work diligently to minimize the intertwining of various temporal states.
# Worship

Said to be one of the first Keepers created by [[../../../../../_Titan Lore/Titan of Time|Time]] itself, [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Eon]] founded the Sisterhood of the Crescent-Moon as a founding stone of the [[../../../Aevi Sphere]]. However, following the establishment of the Sisterhood, Eon vanished from [[../../../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]] and it's influences. With no certainty of [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Eon]]'s whereabouts and no leader, the Sisterhood elected a new leader and revered [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Eon]] as their source of guidance. Some speculate that Eon perished, while others cling to the hope of their eventual return.
