# `= this.Name`
The Guild of Gloaming, entrusted with the guardianship of knowledge, not only tends to the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Chrona Spire/Garden House]] but also oversees various Isles dedicated to cataloguing the lore of every sphere, including that of [[../../../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]]. Within the [[../../../Aevi Sphere]], they are revered as the esteemed Lorekeepers.
# History
# Responsibilities 

The Sages are entrusted with the guardianship of knowledge, whether in the form of ancient artifacts or the reading of [[../../../Aevi Sphere]]. Their primary duty is to maintain a comprehensive archive documenting the past, present, and future.

To manage this vast array of information, the Sages are organized into five factions, each with its own responsibilities and areas of focus.

### 1. [[Sages of The Archive]]

The Sages of the Archive, also referred to as Archive Sages or Archivists, are responsible for documenting folklore and historical records spanning across all Spheres. Their duties extend to preserving scrolls, manuscripts, and other written records from other spheres that have become 'lost to time' within their respective universes.
### 2. [[Sages of Arcane Preservation]]

The Sages of Arcane Preservation, often referred as Arcane Sages, specialize in the collection and cataloguing of artifacts, relics, and magical items found across all spheres. Their responsibilities also include safeguarding any artifacts or manuscripts that possess the potential to cause harm to the [[../../../_Places/Relics/Infinite Hourglass]].

### 3. [[Sages of  Guidance]]

While their name may let these sages come over as handoff and observers, the contrary can not be more true. These sage travel under various guises to different spheres to guid their timeline to the correct flow or explore newly created sphere's and document their temporal mechanics. 
Guides are the most interwoven with the other factions as they often return with new manuscripts, artifacts or in extremely dire cases, warnings.

### 4. [[Sages of Navigation]]

Navigators read the [[../../../Lore Buikding/Ley Lines]] inside [[../../../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]] as well as in other Sphere's and are proficient in pin-pointing potential [[../../../Lore Buikding/Time Rift]]'s. They tend to work closely with [[../The Twelfth Horary/The Twelfth Horary]] as their information source about how to handle the potential [[../../../Lore Buikding/Time Rift]] to ensure temporal balance.
### 5. [[Sages of The Garden House]]

Together with the [[../Sisterhood of The Crescent-Moon/Sisterhood of the Crescent-Moon]] these sages tend to the time flow inside [[../../../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]] as well as the place of creation of the [[../../Races/Timaeth]]. Upon the creation of a child, the Sages begin the process of discovering the new-born's innate affinity that aligns with a faction. Here after the Sages look for a suitable guardian within a faction aligned to the new-borns demonstrated affinity 

# Worship

[[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Umbra]] is the one that Sages turn to when in need for guidance. Created together with the other Keepers, [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Umbra]] was tasked with creating the guild of Gloaming. [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Umbra]] was said to be the last of to disappear amongst the founders. Many that still reside from that time swear that they saw their founder disappear in a flash of raven feather.
Ever since the Sages have engraved a raven into their crest.
