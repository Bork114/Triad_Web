**What are they like?**
_I imagine a very mater oogway type, every guardian has their type of teaching, and mine is more about self growth and understanding everything happens for a reason and there is no accidents_ 

**How was your relationship with them?** 
_The relationship is great, they are in contact often and I go to work with them if I am able_ How was it in the beginning? _It was very rocky, the aloofness of the guardian felt too loose for such a job and it made me feel even more nervous to screw up_ 

**What were the trials that cracked your relationship?**
_The first trial that became my first and only rift. Because of the stress and the fatigue and my stubbornness and non understanding of my guardian's advice, I decided to go forth with my 1st trial. However I did mess up pretty bad and started messing with a linear timeline to make  that was very quickly fixed by the supervisors._

**What mannerisms do they have?** 
_Master oogway.mov._ Which ones do you dislike? _I still don't enjoy some of their sermons as I still don't understand all of them, which tells me I have a lot more to learn_ 

**Which ones do you like?**
_i enjoy our tea talks and work together, the endless stories they have of the hundreds of lines they have created_ Which ones have you taken over? _I open up to complete strangers no matter where they are from_ 

**What is the hardest lesson you had to learn from them?** 
_Sometimes things are meant to fail_ 

**How did you react to it?** 
_Not great as seen as my first big failure, and still not entirely sure about the fact that nothing can't change_ 

**What is the hardest lesson you had to learn without them?** 
_Even the most noble idea can end in ruin_
