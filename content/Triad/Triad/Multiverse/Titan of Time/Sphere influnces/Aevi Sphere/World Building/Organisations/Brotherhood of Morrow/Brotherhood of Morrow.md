The Brotherhood of Morrow is tasked with guiding the formation of new [[../../../Lore Buikding/Ley Lines]] and monitoring existing ones across different Spheres. They collaborate closely with the [[../Guild of Gloaming/Sages of Navigation]] to deliberate on matters concerning [[../../../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]]'s [[../../../Lore Buikding/Ley Lines]].

#### **Look**

Bird like. 
# History

Founded by [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Aurora]], the fist of the Founders, The Brotherhood is often seen as the foundation of [[../../../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]].  Their current leader is [[../../NPC's/Leaders/Aelius]], who took over from a currently retired [[../../NPC's/Genesis]].
# Responsibilities

The Brotherhood oversees the guidance of newly formed [[../../../Lore Buikding/Ley Lines]] in emerging [[../../../../../../../Universe building/Sphere|Spheres]], laying the foundation for the temporal mechanics that will shape these realms. Under their vigilant supervision, [[../../../Lore Buikding/Ley Lines]] are gently guided along their intended course and adjusted as necessary to prevent deviation. The Weavers, in their role, are dedicated to upholding balance across all Spheres, ensuring harmony is maintained at all times.

### Weaving 

The weaving of Ley Lines is crucial to the Brotherhood. Every Ley Line has a path that they follow. They must have a start, a centre and an end. No matter if they branch into multiverses or create paradoxes in Spheres. As long as it is the destined path of the Ley Line, the brotherhood will continue weaving them. 
Notably lines should never overlap, they can only cross over one another. Should lines overlap, a [[../../../Lore Buikding/Time Rift]] will be created.

Weavers spend their time tending to the [[../../../Lore Buikding/Ley Lines]] in the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Nexus Grounds/Halls of Morrow]] on the [[../../../_Places/Cities/Nexus Grounds/Nexus Grounds]] where they tend to the looms of the [[../../../Lore Buikding/Fabric of Time]]. Should their attention be required outside the halls, the weaver will continue their work via means of knitting, crocheting, cross-stitching or any other form that is easy to hold.
# Worship

Following the path that [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Aurora]] has laid before them. As the fist of the keepers, [[../../NPC's/The First Keepers/Aurora]] was tasked with anchoring time form [[../../../../../_Titan Lore/Beyond The Start]] into the [[Cosmic Sea]]. However as the first to arrive, they were also the first to leave.
Many weavers believe that Aurora had woven themselves into the [[../../../Lore Buikding/Fabric of Time]] itself to be able to anchor itself into the cosmic sea.
