Anomolies: Rifts

Time Rifts are one the the [[Anomolies]] that accrue in the Multiverse, namely in the domain of the [[../../../_Titan Lore/Titan of Time]].
Theses rifts can occur when a creature tips the balance in the [[Cyclical Time]], resulting in a deviation of their natural state. There is a degree in severity that these phenomenon can occur.

## Minor Rift

These time rifts might cause small, localized disruptions in time flow. Effects could include temporary glitches such as objects briefly appearing out of place or momentary time loops where events repeat themselves. 
While noticeable, these disturbances would likely be inconsequential and easily overlooked.
#### Solution
Minor Rift are largely ignored, however they will still be monitored. Mostly these rifts are caused by [[Ley Lines]] slightly deviation from their natural path. [[../World Building/Organisations/Brotherhood of Morrow/Brotherhood of Morrow]] is responsible for correcting their deviation.
## Moderate Rifts

Time rifts of moderate severity could result in more significant disruptions, affecting larger areas or longer durations. Examples might include localized time dilation, where time passes at an accelerated or decelerated rate, or the appearance of temporal anomalies like sudden shifts in weather patterns or unexplained disappearances of objects or people.

#### Solution
Observation of the anomaly is required, with potential of detaining the being that is the causation of the Rift. If the rift is caused intentionally the being will be be judged by [[../World Building/Organisations/Sisterhood of The Crescent-Moon/Sisterhood of the Crescent-Moon]] based on their crime. 
If the rift is a result of unsanctioned Chronomancy, the being is stripped of their memories or terminated.
The [[../World Building/Organisations/Brotherhood of Morrow/Brotherhood of Morrow]] will weave the twisting [[Ley Lines]] back into place.

## Severe Rifts

These time rifts would cause substantial disturbances, potentially spanning entire regions or historical periods. Effects could include widespread temporal distortions leading to unpredictable changes in the environment, history, or even the fundamental laws of physics. Significant events might be altered or erased, leading to unsanctioned divergent timelines and paradoxes.

### Solution
Immediate termination of unsanctioned time line is needed, as well removal of any artifacts or manuscripts that would have hinted to its existence.

## **Catastrophic Rifts

Time rifts of this magnitude have even influence into the Aevi sphere and have a significant impact on the [[../_Places/Relics/Infinite Hourglass]]. Entire civilizations or ecosystems might be wiped out, as timelines collapse or merge chaotically. Reality itself could unravel, leading to the annihilation of entire universes or the creation of alternate realities with drastically different properties.

### Solution
Immediate termination of the Sphere is needed. All factions need to reverse the damage done to [[../_Places/Relics/Infinite Hourglass]].

## Apocalyptic Rift

If a rift of this magnitude manifests, [[../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]] itself is on the verge of collapsing. Guidance of [[../../../_Titan Lore/Titan of Time|Time]] is to be asked. Potential of  losing [[../../../_Titan Lore/Titan of Time|Time]]'s anchor is is highly likely. Let's pray that [[../../../../Titan of Death/_Titan Lore/Titan of Death|The End]] is kind to us.
