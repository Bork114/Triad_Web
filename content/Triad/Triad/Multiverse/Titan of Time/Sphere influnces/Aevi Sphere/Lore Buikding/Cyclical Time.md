# `= this.Name`

The Cyclical Time is the state of Time in general. One might refer to it as the Circle of Time.
# General Information

The Cyclical Time is the grand design of [[../../../_Titan Lore/Titan of Time|Time]] itself. All that starts needs to end, all that ends must start. It is the baseline on which every [[Ley Lines]] operates, no matter the route that it should take. Should the cycle of time ever be broken, [[../Aevi Sphere|Aevi]] will fall, releasing the anchor that Time has from [[../../../_Titan Lore/Beyond The Start]]. %%Sphere's time machinations will continue to rotate but will eventually collide.%%
