As warmth envelops you, like a comforting embrace, you find yourself feeling hollow and discontent, despite the soothing sensation. The more you dwell on this emptiness, the hotter it becomes, until a blinding light fills your vision. You try to close your eyes only to find that they are already sealed shut.

Upon opening your eyes, you fin yourself surrounded by golden sand, seemingly emanating from your own body.

Hazily you watch as a robed figure gently picks you up and positions you with practiced ease on their hip before walking into seemingly a random direction. 
Instinctively as you grasp their robe, your golden glow tinges their garments. Slowly you shift your gaze from the golden glow to take in your surroundings, an easy feat from your current vantage point.
An ever moving garden out golden sand. Patterns are raked into the ground, akin to a zen garden, while twisting trees hold fruits in various sizes that appear to be made out of golden sand. After taking a closer look at those fruits a though pops into your head, *'I came out of one of those'.*

During your revelation and wonder the figure seemed to have reached their destination, a chuckle snaps your focus to them. 

"You child, are [[../../Triad/Multiverse/Titan of Time/World Building/Races/Timaeth.md]], just like me. We are the children of Time and as such we are tasked with maintaining it's continues flow. Just as we fulfil our duties, so too shall you. What those task are will be decided by what faction you belong to."

"See those four symbols?" ask the figure, pointing to symbols carved in small obelisks, a sun, a crescent-moon, a raven, and lastly a rising Phoenix. Each obelisk is accompanied by a bowl at its base, and a stone path leads to where you currently stand.

"They represent our ways of living, our guiding principles," the figure elucidates. "The Sun signifies the Brotherhood of Morrow. They are entrusted with weaving and guiding the Ley Lines that compose universes, under the guidance of Aurora, ensuring balance. Just as I am guiding you now, they too shepherd new Spheres in forming their own temporal mechanisms."

"Next to the Sun, we have the Crescent-Moon. The Sisterhood of the Crescent-Moon, dedicated caretakers of the Infinite Hourglass, the beating heart of Aevi. Guided by Eon, these sisters anchor time within this realm, ensuring its stability. They also oversee the closure of timelines across Spheres and administer punishment to those who dare tamper with the design of Time itself."

"The Raven, adjacent to the Sisterhood, represents the Guild of Gloaming. Guided by Umbra, its members, known as Sages or Lorekeepers, are devoted to meticulous documentation. To alleviate this vast undertaking, the Sages are divided into five distinct factions. The Sages of Guidance monitor the temporal states of Spheres, while the Sages of Navigation maintain an up-to-date ledger of Ley Lines across Spheres. Sages of Arcane Preservation safeguard artifacts, while the Sages of The Archive preserve written lore. Lastly, the Sages of The Garden House nurture newly formed life."

As a slight tilt of their head draws your attention, it becomes evident that they are speaking not only to you but also to those still lingering in the golden garden. Slowly, you turn your head back to the symbols.

"The final symbol, The Rising Pheonix, represents The Twelfth Horary, the knights of Aevi and Time. They serve as peacekeepers across universes and realms. The Clandestine, also known as Swords, traverse the Spheres and dedicate their lives to eliminating Time Rifts. This duty is not without peril, for though Timaeth may be timeless, death may still find us in battle. The Shindrals, or Shields, stand ever vigilant over Aevi, protecting us all in times of peril. Both hold Meridian's guidance in their hearts as a they protect Time itself."

The Sage crouches down and gently places you on the ground, supporting your body as you stand on the first stone of the dividing paths. Your focus remains fixed on the symbols and their significance, the sensation of the figure subtly guiding your body lost in the intensity of your contemplation.

"Go forth, child," the Sage speaks softly, "listen to your heart's desire and find your path."

With determination, you wobble forward, stepping stone by stone. Before you realize it, you stand before the basin filled with water, its tranquil surface beckoning you. It promises the final peace that would make you whole. As you dip your golden hands into the water, it begins to seep into you, solidifying your being. Your previous sandy exterior dims, flaking away to reveal a new form. As you take in your transformed body, the Sage's voice once again fills the space.

"We welcome you, child of Time. Your essence is your faction, just as your faction is your essence. Under their guidance, you will grow, as we have grown under our own."
