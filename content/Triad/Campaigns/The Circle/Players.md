# February: Character Creation

During this month I would like to sit together with everyone to create their character. I would suggest everyone to read chapter 2 of the rule book that goes over everything about you as a player need to know about creating a character.
Don't worry about filling a character sheet, that is something you and I will do together. However there are some things that I would like you to already have some idea on.

## Race / Look
**ARC does not work with races or species, you are completely free to chose however you want to look like**. However I am putting some restrictions on what you are. The reason for this is that whatever you decide to look like is going to be reflected on you Faction. **You are basically deciding what the rest of the people in you factions look like.** 
Keep it somewhat time related, can be an embodiment of something (Seasons, Zodiacs, Clocks, ... ) or a representation of it (Sand, infinity, elementals,...). Your character does not have to be humanoid, you're children of Time reality is something that does not apply to you.
You can use DnD races if that's more your jam, however keep away from fish people, mermaids/ sirens and any other sea dweller.

**Do kindly give me picture, collage or art of some kind**. If not from your character of how you think the faction should look like, it makes it for me easier too visualize what you want.

## Classes
**Your class is your faction**. ARC has no classes, however there is magic and you can all fight in some capability. Depending on your faction some can do more than others.

## Guardian / Background
After choosing your faction, your character was assigned to **one** guardian. What I would like to know about them is:

- What are they like?
- How was your relationship with them?
	- How was it in the beginning?
	- What were the trials that cracked your relationship?
	- What were the trials that healed your relationship?
- How did they teach you the ways of your faction?
- What mannerisms do they have?
	- Which ones do you dislike?
	- Which ones do you like?
	-  Which ones have you taken over?
- What is the hardest lesson you had to learn from them?
	- How did you react to it?
- What is the hardest lesson you had to learn without them?
	- How did your guardian react to it?
- What is the one moment your guardian did something that will forever stay with you?


What I wish to know about **your character**:

- How are you currently living your life?
- How revered are you in the faction? (Can be quite high)
	- What do the people admire about you?
	- What rumours are there about you? (Can be good or bad)
- What are your goals inside your faction?
- What were your highs?
- What were your lows?
- At the moment that your training was over and you had to do things by yourself, how did you feel?

Think about this information when creating your character, so that you have an idea already when we have a session zero for creating your character.
